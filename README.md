# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bil!

My name is Bilawal, but everyone calls me Bil. I am a senior full-stack engineer (with a preference towards backend) with 8 years of professional experience, although I have been coding for 20 years now. I have worked in 3 startups as well as larger companies, specifically Spotify and Intercom.

You will find me either writing code (Java, Go, Ruby, TypeScript), meeting new people, speaking at events, or lost somewhere in the documentation. Possibly on one of the following platforms:
